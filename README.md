  <h1>NVelox</h1>

**NOTE**

NVelox was supposed to be a plugin system alternative to RPC. Providing bindings for Rust, Crystal, etc.
The proof of concept works right now(you can set options, print messages, schedule tasks), but it's a lot of work to wrap the entire API.

I've decided to stall the development right now and focus on other things.
